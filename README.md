# fhevmjs React Template

This template can get you started with interacting with the Inco Network (currently with the Gentry Testnet) using a React application. It already has fhevmjs and a wallet connection set up.

## Get Started

Then install the required modules: \
`npm install ` \
After that run the app using: \
`npm run dev `

The app will be running on http://localhost:5173/.

## Next Steps

Take a look at the [Inco Network documentation](https://docs.inco.org) to learn more about all the operations you can do.
